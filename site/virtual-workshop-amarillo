# Invitation

## Join our virtual designer's design workshop this spring!

Decentralization is full of hard UX problems waiting for talented designers to tackle. 

This spring, we invite you to collaborate with other designers experienced in decentralized technologies. This time, we will have a smaller group (maximum 8) designers. We will focus on how 'identity'/'me'/'us' works in a decentralized application, and how we can envision a new way to relate to each other and ourselves in these digital spaces.

If you are interested in attending, please send an email to team@decentpatterns.xyz with your name, email address, and how you found out about this workshop. 

Feel free to prepare to share any work in progress or old designs that never made it to the implementation phase.
